title: The History of the High Fives 5K
---
The idea of the High Fives 5K was first conceived by John Hansen while he was running along 11th Avenue in the fall of 2002. As a long time resident of the avenues, John was impressed by the fact that this neighborhood has many men, women and children who enjoy running. In contemplating creating a race for the High Aves, the idea was formed of a race that would be unique for the High Aves. The idea was to hold a FIVE-K race at FIVE thousand feet of altitude, and to start the race at 5:55pm on the FIFTH day of the 5th month. Hence, the name The High Fives 5K. Appropriately, the first sponsor of the High Fives 5K was the Ensign FIFTH Ward.

**2003** - The first running of the High Fives 5K took place on Saturday May 15th 2003. Torrential rainstorms lasted throughout the afternoon, right up until race time,(causing the registration to be completed inside the church building). But when the race was to begin, the skies cleared and the rains stopped until the race was finished. The first person to cross the finish line in the first High Fives 5K was Kevin Murphy with a time of 18:49. The first female to finish the race was Kristen Monson. In all, 65 participants completed that inaugural High Fives 5K.

**2004** - When the second High Fives 5K was held there were some things that had changed since the first race just one year before. First, the LDS Church reorganized the ward boundaries in the Avenues and the Ensign FIFTH Ward was disbanded, with members being transferred to the Emigration 4th and 6th Wards. On top of that, the 18th Avenue Church building, where the race begins and ends, caught fire that spring and was closed for restoration. Undaunted though, the second annual High Fives 5K took place on Saturday May 8th 2004. A Kid's 555 Dash was added as an event before the 5K. A very excited group of young boys and girls 10 years old or younger dashed off with such speed and excitement that the results of that race were never recorded. But they had fun!

The field for the second High Fives 5K was made up of over 75 men, women and children. Despite strong competition, Kevin Murphy was able to repeat as the overall winner of the race. He also earned the sportsmanship award when he tried to declare Jordan Henderson the winner of the race. As 18 year old Jordan Henderson was crossing the finish line as the second finisher, Kevin explained that Jordan was in the lead after the 2 mile mark but took a wrong turn and went the wrong direction for a short time which cost him the lead. Because of this unfortunate mistake, the course is now more clearly identified for the runners at that intersection. Like Kevin Murphy the men's division winner, Kristen Monson was able to successfully defend her title as the female winner of the 5K.

**2006** - The third running of the High Fives 5K occurred on Friday May 5th, 2006. Having the race on a Friday afternoon rather than a Saturday resulted in a smaller number of participants. Kevin Murphy was unable to run in this race due to a scheduling conflict, opening the door for a new men's champion. Miles Petty took this opportunity and crossed the line first making him the winner of the 2006 High Fives 5K. Kristen Monson continued her domination of the women's division by taking home her third straight title.

**2007** - On May 19th 2007, the fourth High Five 5K took place with a clear up turn in participation and results both in the race and on the sidelines. For his Eagle Scout project, Thomas Hansen organized the return of the KIDS 555 FOOT DASH and created this High Fives web site. Twenty five children, under 12 years of age, entered the dash. 10 year old Keifer Nunley crossed the finish line first! The 5K race had a record 82 finishers. Kristen Monson, busy with her wedding reception that evening, was unable to defend her record of winning the women’s race in all of the past High Fives 5Ks. The new women’s champion this year was 15 year old Eliza Hale. The men’s race saw its youngest champion ever when 16 year old Daniel Wray was the first to cross the finish line. Judy Eror and the Emigration 6th Ward Activities Committee went all out in providing root beer floats and an incredibly delicious post race BBQ dinner for all of the runners and spectators, making the activity far more than just another 5K Race. Thank you Judy and all the other volunteers!

**2008** - The fifth running of the High Fives 5K took place under perfect weather conditions on Saturday May 9th, 2008. The race received unprecedented support from volunteers and neighbors who came out to help make this unique high avenues event a tremendous success. Special Thanks to Michelle Rigby who sacrificed her sanity and her car in order to help make available the massive Balloon Banner from the day's earlier Race for the Cure event. The kids dash had an enthusiastic crowd of 25 young runners. Nine year old Hayden Banz was the first place boys finisher and the first place finisher for the girls was Eight year old Tana Raynor.

 The 2008 High Fives 5K was memorable for its incredibly young and fast field of runners. The first seven finishers were all under 18 years of age! In fact, 10 of the first 12 finishers were also under 18. A new course record was set by John McMinn, a seventeen year old star on the West High Cross Country Team. McCall Knowlton, a friend of the avenues, who lives in the foothill neighborhood, broke the course record for female finishers. As shown on the Course Records page on this web site, half of the 26 Course Records were broken this year.

**2009** - The 2009 High Fives 5K included another strong field of runners. The 5K included an interesting historical first. In this, the sixth High Fives 5K, we had three past male winners, Kevin Murphy, Miles Petty and Daniel Wray, (who collectively had won four of the five High Fives 5Ks) all returning to compete in this year's race. These three past winners ran strong and all finished within the first six finishers, however the first person to cross the finish line (he was in a hurry to get to the Eagle's rock concert in Sandy) was Jordan Henderson. The female winner of the 2009 High Fives 5K was Ellie Burton. The historic aspect of her win was that, at just twelve years of age, she is the youngest High Fives 5K winner ever. Congratulations Ellie! Another amazing youth storyline was Michael Thompson's fourth place overall finish, also at the tender age of 12. In the Kids' Dash we had a record number of participants: 32. The Dash was won by 10 year old Hayden Banz, followed closely by the Pihl brothers, Sam and Nick This year we have recorded, for the first time, the ages and order of finishers for the Kid's Dash in the Kids' Dash page of this website.

**2010** - The 2010 High Fives 5K had an extra challengefor the runner: ROAD CONSTRUCTION! Dispite the hazzards created by the seemingly unending doad work (which continued all spring) a record large field of 97 racers successfully navigated the obsticles. Seven new course records were set. Two of these new course records were set by Avenues' residents who missed the last two High Fives 5Ks because they were across the globe serving LDS missions. Ben Hansen returned from Taiwan and was the male winner of the race while setting a new course record for the Male 19-24 division. Robert Edwards, who recently returned with his wife from serving in Romania, smashed the previous course record for the 70+ Male division.
 The Kids' Dash also saw a record number of participants (45) and won was by Sawyer Nunley. The female winner of the Kids' Dash was Christa Kroger.

**2011** - The 2011 High Fives 5K, Kid's Dash and Dinner was another wonderful neighborhood event! Another strong field of runners (73 finishers) completed the 5K race and 41 children finished the inaugural 1/5th Mile Kid's Sprint (formerly a 555 foot Dash). The 1/5th mile sprint winners were Ben Devries (grandson of Herb and Jodee Flindt) and Tana Raynor. The 5K race was won by Tyler Bodily (a grandson of Ron and Pat Smith) and Kendall Morrison (who set a new course record for overall female finisher and her age division finisher). Two additional course records were set by Alendra McDowell (female 12-13 age division) and Rober Edwards (who broke his own course record in the 70+ male division).

**2012** - The 2012 High Fives 5K, Kids' Sprint and Dinner continued the success of this great neighborhood tradition. For the Sixth Year in a row there was both a new Male winner and a new female winner in the 5K. Overall winners Kevin Smith and Jane Maus (a 17 year old neighorhood runner who took 3rd overall!) both set new course records!

This years race had many impressive and noteworth events occur, but two particularly significant accomplishments , involving our oldest and youngest 5K finishers, deserve to be recorded in this High Fives History. First, five year old Eliot Engberson joined the field of over 82 runners at the starting line of the 5K. When the race began, all of the runners sprinted down the hill and young Eliot was accidentally knocked down and scraped his body on the asphalt. But showing an amazing determination beyond his years, Eliot got up and was determined to continue running the race. And he Did! He finished the race in 41:07 and was the youngest race finisher! The second story to mention is about Dick Smiley. At 84 years of age Dick was the oldest participant in the 5K. Dick did two training runs the week before the race to make sure he could still do it, and he did! Dick was pleased to finish the course in 54 minutes.

**2013** - This will be the 10th running of the High Fives 5K! We look forward to another great evening of running and associating together in our Avenues Neighborhood, and hope that you will be able to join us for this great evening. We also hope that you will invite your neighbors , friends and extended families to come join with us as well.

**Considering the successes of our younger and older runners, and in light of the fabulous support of the neighborhood, the High Fives 5K is alive and well and getting stronger each year.**
