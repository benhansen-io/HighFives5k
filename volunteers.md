Again this year we will need many volunteers to assist with the following responsibilities:

1. Race Registration
2. Race Video/Photographers
3. Gatorade/Water  Tables
4. Motorized Escort for Race Leaders (thank you Jim Ostler)
5. Race Timers
6. Traffic Controlers
7. Finish Line Tag Remover
8. Finish Line Race Recorders (2)
9. Finish Line Medallion Providers (2)
10. Post Race Dinner (many helpers wanted)

Thank you volunteers for your invaluable service at this annual neighborhood event!
